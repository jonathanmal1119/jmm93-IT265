#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I replayed Apex Legends, valorant and BO7 to understand what makes them bad.
  - I narrowed down my game idea to a card game
  - im considering doing a spin on a gambling card game 
- **Challenges faced**:
  - No challenges faced this week. The asignment was struaght forward.
- **Solutions**:
  - for the card game, I enjoy card games so adding a twist in it would make for a good idea for the midterm and final.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- I learned how to innovate in bad ideas rather than just remove it.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- Thinking about scaleabikity is  extremly hard not only for game design but also traditional software. making a program be scalable for hundreds or thousands can be a completely differnt design.


#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- Flesh out the full idea for the midterm and prepare for the next case study.
