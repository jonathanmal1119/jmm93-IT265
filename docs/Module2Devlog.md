#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Atari HW assignment
- [x] Choose game
- [x] PlayTest game
- [x] Finish the rest of the hw
- [x] Look over the slides and review them


#### Progress
  - I looked over the slides and reviewed everything once again.
  - I chose atari boxing as my case study game
  - I completed the atari case study
    
- **Challenges faced**:
  -  The initial websites did not work and had the atari games taken down
  -  Some of the questions ask were a little confusing and didnt line up with my game such as main plot points for my boxing game.

- **Solutions**:
  -  I found another website that allowed me to play boxing.
  -  I used YT videos to find some gameplay as well

#### Learnings
-  I learned that Atari boxing was one of Activisons first games which was surprizing and it was interesting learning how Activison got started.
-  I had to find alternatives to run the game online becuase some of the linkes didnt work

#### Free Thinking
- Fun assignment and overall nice break from other HW this semester.

#### Next Steps
- Think about midterm project and what I want to do for it.
